# SquadRemoteAdmin
A desktop application used to remote admin a Squad Or Post-Scriptum game server.

This version adds pre-configured Map and game management facilities (End game, Restart game, Change Map and Set Next Map). It also allows for alternate game and query ports to be added, and some persistence of the configuration.

This version forked from the OWI original to add new management elements.
